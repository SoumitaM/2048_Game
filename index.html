            <h2>Game objective:</h2>
            <h3>Your goal is to slide numbered tiles around the grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.</h3>
            <h2>Game Controls:</h2>

<h3>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all tiles in that direction.
On mobile devices or touchscreen computers, you can often swipe in the direction you want the tiles to move.</h3>
<h2>Gameplay Mechanics:</h2>

<h3>Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.
If two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they merge into a tile with the sum of the two numbers.</h3>
<h2>Scoring:</h2>

<h3>Your score is based on the numbers on the merged tiles. Each merge adds to your score.</h3>
<h2>Winning and Losing:</h2>

<h3>You win the game when you create a tile with the number 2048.
The game ends when the grid fills up and no more moves are possible.</h3>
<h2>Strategies:</h2>

<h3>Plan your moves ahead to keep higher-numbered tiles together and create opportunities for merging.
Try to avoid filling up the board too quickly.</h3>
